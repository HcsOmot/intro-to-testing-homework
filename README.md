# intro-to-testing-homework
Homework for group 1 (2017-11-25)

## Individual assignments

Each assignment should be done as a separate Pull Request to this repo and it will be reviewed by others.

Deadline is Monday, December 4th at 23:59. 

### Assignment 1: Implement calculateWithPercentage() using floats not integers

On the workshop we implemented this for integers, now lets do it for floats/doubles with precision on 2nd decimal.

Scenario: Calculating sales tax 
Given in USA prices do not include sales tax
And sales tax is 8%
When a person is buying a product for $100.00
They have to pay $108.00


Scenario: Rounding up sales tax

Given in USA prices do not include sales tax

And sales tax is 8%

And cent is the smallest measure

When a person is buying a product for $100.01

They have to pay $108.02 since we need to round up the number to next cent

### Assignment 2: Frog jump: Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

This one is from codility https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/

### Assignment 3: Brackets: Determine whether a given string of parentheses (multiple types) is properly nested.

## Team assignment: Currency exchange

Deadline is Wednesday, December 6th at 23:59. 

Teams are as they were on the workshop, Tomo & FilipLa and Fran & FilipB.

Build the core of the application that can calculate if customer bought euros 7 days ago, would they be earning money or not.

For the API, you can use http://hnbex.eu/api/v1/

Scenario: Earning

Given median EUR exchange rate was 7.5 seven days ago

And median EUR exchange rate is 7.6 today

When I would have bought them then and sold today 

Then I would earn 0.1 per each EUR I bought


Scenario: No changes

Given median EUR exchange rate was 7.4 seven days ago

And median EUR exchange rate is 7.4 today

When I would have bought them then and sold today 

Then I would have not earned or lost anything

Scenario: Loosing money

Given median EUR exchange rate was 7.6 seven days ago

And median EUR exchange rate is 7.4 today

When I would have bought them then and sold today 

Then I would loose 0.2 per each EUR I bought

Notices:

1) Talk to your team mate about structure of the code
2) Split tasks evenly (I know exact 50% split is not possible but it's more important to work together then to do the assignment!)
3) You should work on the same branch (not master)
4) I expect 100% test coverage
5) I suggest mocking as much as possible
6) Do create live test that will connect to API and return the live data
7) Create a pull request to this repo so the other team/group can review it (don't forget, if the other group reviews they don't know the assignment!)
8) As we are building the core of the app, there is no ui/console or anything so tests should make you comfortable in how it works.

If you have any questions, ask on the group1 Slack channel.
